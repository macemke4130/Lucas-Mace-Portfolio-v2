            <p><span>Hello! My name is Lucas.</span> I am a full stack web developer
                currently
                living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I love working with React and building front and back end
                applications.
                Currently, Iâ€™m learning more about GraphQL and how it has the potential to be an industry changing
                technology.</p>

            <p>From 2005 to 2012 I had an amazing time working in the still budding world of web
                development.
                Developers needed to wear many hats as it was then still a relatively new industry. As a result, I
                needed to learn many technologies all at once.</p>

            <p>For the past 10 years I have been working as a Service Manager and Bicycle Repair
                Mechanic around the
                midwest. My career in the outdoor industry has taken me many amazing places and introduced me to so
                many wonderful and kind people, but during the pandemic of 2020 I knew it was time for a change. I
                never stopped missing web development, so I decided to get back into the game.</p>

            <p>I enrolled in the Full Stack Developer course at <a href="https://covalence.io/"
                target="_blank" class="white-link">Covalence</a> and graduated in March of 2021 after 6 months
                of daily classes
                and labs. I found that I retained much of the logic skills from
                my previous career. Coding in Javascript was like seeing an old friend again.</p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy riding and fixing bicycles, brewing coffee in new and
                interesting ways,
                camping, photography and coding fun projects.</p>
